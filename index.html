The app provides "role-based access, allowing "Presidents" to oversee unit operations, approve financial transactions, and schedule meetings, while "members" can sell products, track earnings, and apply for loans. The "financial tracking module" helps users monitor "income, expenses, and savings", ensuring financial transparency and better decision-making. The "online marketplace" allows members to "sell products beyond local markets, expanding economic opportunities through digital sales and marketing tools. The "'loan management module" simplifies the process of "applying for and tracking loans", providing easy access to financial assistance. A "real-time update module" keeps users informed with "instant notifications" about transactions, meetings, and product updates, ensuring better communication and coordination. The app is "secure, scalable, and easy to use", making it accessible even for users with minimal technical knowledge. By integrating "unit management, financial tracking, marketplace features, and real-time updates, Kudumbashree.io "'empowers women entrepreneurs, enhances communication, and ensures "'efficient and transparent" Kudumbashree unit operations. This platform plays a crucial role in "digitizing and modernizing" Kudumbashree, fostering "economic sustainability and growth" for its members.</li>
